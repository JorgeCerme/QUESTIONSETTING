QUESTION SETTING APP : USER GUIDE

This app is able to store questions at specific locations decided by the user into the database which is later shown on the Location-Based Quiz App. To see this app follow: https://github.com/JorgeCerme/LOCATIONBASEDQUIZAPP.git.

The app is simple, clear and intuitive and its layout is composed of 7 text boxes including a question text, 4 different options, the correct answer, latitude value and longitude value text boxes. These last ones have the inbuilt function of clicking on a location on the map and it automatically fills in the latitude and the longitude values.

Once the question setting form is filled, completed and submitted, the questions are stored in the database which can be accessed via different software (pgAdmin III - PostgreSQL.).
